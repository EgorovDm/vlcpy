python-vlc
==========

My patches and fixes for [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/VLC/), libvlc and particularly the [Python Bindings](https://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings) for libvlc.  These are all within the VLC directory, for the purposes of providing a parallel or shadow of the VLC development directory and project structure.

This code is intended as a patch (fulfilling part of the TODO list) for the libvlc code and is thus released under the same license as the libvlc code (i.e LGPL 2.1 or any later version), though it is multi-licensed with other options available.  All current licenses are in the LICENSES/ directory, though that does not apply to those files sourced entirely from the [VideoLan](http://www.videolan.org/) projects.  As the libvlc repositories were not included in the publicly forkable/patchable repositories and as the workaround through the main VLC public repo may not actually work, I'm putting it all here too.

It's actually more likely that this code will be updated more readily than the cobbled together attempt to use the "official" public repo because it works and does so reasonably consistently.  I am unlikely to see that on the VLC repo until the VideoLAN team provide a public instance of the libvlc and Python Bindings repos which can be used for patching and code contribution as their primary VLC public repo is.
